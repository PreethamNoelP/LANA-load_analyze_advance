# LANA - Load, Analyze and Advance

**LANA** is an intuitive and powerful platform that helps you **load data, analyze it efficiently, and advance with actionable insights**.  
Designed to handle **large datasets with token-efficient processing**, LANA makes data analysis **fast, interactive, and smart**.

##  Features
- **Load**: Import data files or enter data manually  
- **Analyze**: Generate charts and visualizations (line, bar, scatter, heatmap, etc.)  
- **Statistics**: Compute mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and perform linear regression  
- **Optimize**: Token-efficient processing for **large-scale datasets**  
- **Export**: Save analysis as **PDF or Word reports**

##  Status
This repository is **currently private** - the code is **not publicly displayed**.  
We’re actively upgrading it to handle **large, unstructured datasets** including documents, images, and videos while keeping token usage **highly optimized**.
